# Face_recogintion_lightingprocess
Based on Enhanced Local Texture Feature Sets for Face Recognition under Difficult Lighting Conditions papers. 

There are three main contributions:(i) we present a simple and efficient preprocessing chain that eliminates most of the effects of changing illumination while still preserving the essential appearance details that are needed for recognition; (ii) we introduce Local Ternary Patterns (LTP), a generalization of the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) local texture descriptor that is more discriminant and less sensitive to noise in uniform regions; and (iii) we show that replacing local histogramming with a local distance transform based similarity metric further improves the performance of LBP/LTP based face recognition.
